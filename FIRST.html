                <p><i>FIRST</i> is an international organization that looks to expand the influence of STEM in schools and society as a whole. 
                    FIRST stands for ‘For Inspiration and Recognition in Science and Technology.’ The mission of FIRST is to inspire young 
                    people to be science and technology leaders and innovators, by engaging them in exciting Mentor-based programs that 
                    build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities 
                    including self-confidence, communication, and leadership. FIRST also stands by their core values of coopertition and gracious 
                    professionalism.</p>

                <h2>What is the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition?</h2>
                <p>The FIRST Robotics Competition is a rigorous competition in which each team builds a robot to complete the objectives given 
                    on the day of kickoff. Teams are given six weeks to design, build, and program their robot before they must package it 
                    away. Teams are then only allowed to use their robot at competitions.

                    Their are two types of FRC competitions. Teams can compete in regional events and/or district events. If a team does well 
                    in these competitions, they can compete on the international scale at either the FRC World Championships or the FRC District 
                    Championships.</p>

                <h2>What is the structure of FRC team?</h2>
                <p>The nature of the FIRST Robotics Competition requires members with a wide variety of abilities. Any student is valuable to 
                    the team because of the necessity for people with different talents. Teams are often made up of four teams, a mechanical 
                    team, a programming team, a communications team, and a field team. Additionally, teams have a drive team for competitions.</p>

                <h2>How does <i>FIRST</i> impact the students?</h2>
                <p>FIRST and FRC impacts students greatly. Students are given valuable life experiences in STEM as well as life lessons in 
                    leadership and working as a team with the help of advisors and mentors. Students are also given the opportunity to earn 
                    scholarships through FIRST, which can benefit them in their adult life. According to the FIRST website, “Over 88% have 
                    more interest in doing well in school and 92% are more interested in attending college.”</p>
