                All math classes in the 8th grade attend a one-day event where they are offered different stations relating to computer science. Our robotics team hosts one of the stations and teaches the students about the team. At the end of each session, we invite students to launch and catch balls from the 2022 season robot. After starting Code Con, there was a notable increase in the amount of interested Freshmen joining our team.

                Our high school has a program, COVE, that serves students with developmental disabilities. To help spread STEM education to these students, we invited them to drive our robot and launch and catch pieces from our 2022 season robot. Additionally, we assisted the students with a hands-on learning session that showed them how to build a basic circuit, teaching them the principles of electrical engineering.

                In 2019, we started mentoring our middle school’s robotics team by answering questions and advising them on what they could improve. We also helped facilitate their in-house FLL competition. Additionally, we mentor FRC 7730. Through visits from both their members and our members, we have assisted and given suggestions to them in finding sponsorships, creating fundraisers, building their robot, team management, training and retaining membership, etc.

                    In 2022, we began a collaboration with Kiwimbi International, which provides educational opportunities to communities in Western Kenya. Through bi-weekly virtual meetings and scratch workbooks donated by our team, we introduced computer science to students at St. Thomas Amagaro Girls Secondary School.  After the success of these lessons, we helped form an all-girls robotics team, STAGSS, which competed in the Kenya Science Engineering Fair. We assisted them by maintaining a website of resources, creating video tutorials, and continuing to meet virtually. The STAGSS robotics team went on to eventually win their local, county, regional, and national competitions.
