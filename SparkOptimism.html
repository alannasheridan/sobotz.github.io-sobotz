                Project Invent is a competition dedicated to using technology to improve the lives of others. To solve authentication issues at places that needed to track attendance, our Software Subteam created affordable Facial Recognition Attendance Software for the Police Athletic League. Our group was awarded $500 and was given permission to further develop the software to share with other organizations.

                 Recently, one of our alumni, who served at the Air Force Academy for two years, came back to become a mentor for our Software subteam. His service in the military inspired us to connect with Friends Of The Troops, a volunteer-led nonprofit organization that supports and honors Veterans and members of the U.S. Armed Forces. To reach out to these veterans, our members made cards to send to several Veteran Homes on Valentine’s Day, and we make monthly Birthday and appreciation cards.

This past year, we had fifteen alumni come back, introduce themselves to our current members, and talk about their experience on SO BOTZ. After the party, we gained another mentor as one of our alumni wanted to help our team’s effort once again.

                    The Penguin Plunge is a not-for-profit organization that helps families of seriously ill children meet their medical costs. Every year, this organization raises money for four children by having people volunteer and sponsor those who plunge into the Hudson River. As this year’s plunge is on the same day as our Week 0 event, we created a Mario Kart Tournament for our high schoolers as another way to fundraise and spread awareness for these children.
