                Before 8th graders go into high school, they attend an event where they get to view different programs offered in 
                the school. We teach the students about our team by preparing a presentation, having members talk about their 
                experiences, and demonstrating our previous season’s robot. With this, we motivate incoming freshmen to join our 
                team in the fall.

                    answer any questions that they have about our team. Prior to the start of our season, we also have Parent Night, where 
                    we talk to members’ parents about our robotics program, what their children will be doing, and events that will be held.

                    In 2023, our members attended a virtual meeting held by the United Nations NGO CSW Forum, an event that 
                    informs and engages efforts for gender equality advocacy worldwide. With over 15,000 participants from 139 
                    different countries, this meeting aimed to inspire the support of women across the globe. At this event, 
                    we shared our experience empowering young women in Kenya with representatives from Kiwimbi International 
                    and STAGSS robotics team. By introducing computer science, engineering, and technology to the students at St. 
                    Thomas Amagaro Girl’s Secondary School, we’ve opened up new opportunities and experiences for these girls. 
                    While they initially had little experience with using tech, we taught them how to create Google accounts, 
                    send emails, meet virtually through Google Meet, etc. Through resources and materials donated by our team, 
                    regular communication, and the help of all our members, we have helped these girls grow their knowledge, 
                    allowing them to extend their learning into their communities.

                    this as an opportunity to spread awareness of our team by allowing interested students to drive our robot, similar 
                    to that of a rover on the moon.
